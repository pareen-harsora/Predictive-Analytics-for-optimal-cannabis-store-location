# Predictive-Analytics-for-optimal-cannabis-store-location
In the evolving landscape of the retail industry, I aimed to make strategic decisions by harnessing the power of data-driven insights. As the demand for cannabis products continues to grow, I faced the exciting challenge of identifying optimal store locations in Canada that will maximize cannabis sales and ensure long-term success.

By integrating demographic information, historical sales data, economic indicators, geographic factors, and sentiment analysis, I aim to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and trends that will guide its expansion strategy.

This will showcase the methodology, insights, and recommendations derived from the analysis, shedding light on the exciting journey of turning data into actionable strategies for growth and profitability in the cannabis retail sector.

I have the presentation file in my repository for a preview of everything I am aiming to accomplish in this project.
